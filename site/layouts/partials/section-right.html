                <p class="text-gray-500 leading-relaxed">With the move to value based care (VBC) and increased risk
                    bearing contracts, proven solutions to reduce readmissions is critical. Leverage evidence based
                    models to reduce readmissions in your context. Programs such as Heart
                    Safe Motherhood have shown readmisions reductions from 5% to 1%.</p>
