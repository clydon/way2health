bgcolor: "#242F40"
subtitle: Design, discover, and deploy personalized interventions at scale with re-usable modules.
introtitle: Mix and match modules to tailor interventions for desired outcomes
introsubtitle: Way to Health capabilities are built and made available as re-usable modules. 
introtext: Researchers and clinicians have combinewd these modules in different ways to create innovative interventions rapidly, test them and quickly deploy them fully integrated with their EHR. 

modules:
  introtitle: Build your own intervention quickly
  introsubtitle: Way to Health capabilities are grouped into modules. Configure them to address your specific needs and combine them together to quickly build, test and deploy interventions. Choose your deployment model - pilot, standalone or scaled and EHR integrated.

      subtitle1: Two-way Texting
      description1: Communication with patients and / or study participants is key to engaging them in their health. You can choose from a variety of communication techniques or combine them in interesting ways tailored to a patient's behavior. Texting (SMS) has repeatedly been demonstrated to be a very effective way of communicating with patients since it works irrespective of the kind of phone the patient has. Texts can be sent out based on set schedules and / or rules. These configuration rules can be as simple as responding with a personalized "Great job, John Appleseed" or as complex as evaluating blood pressure values and responding with an provider or nurse alert
      subtitle2: Survey Management
      description2: In cases where more data needs to be collected (demographics, symptoms, etc.), the system offers the ability to create a survey. You can either integrate the survey with Qualtrics or create your own survey from scratch using the built-in survey creation and deployment tool. These surveys can be sent out to patients based on specific schedules and simple or complex rules. Short surveys can be administrated over text as well.

      subtitle1: Vitals and Activity Monitoring
      description1: The platform integrates directly with a number of biomedical devices to capture vitals directly from the patient / participant. The kinds of vitals captured include blood pressure, medication adherence, sleep tracking, weight, blood glucose and many more continue to be added. Additional devices are added quickly on request.
      subtitle2: Patient Reported Outcomes
      description2: The system also allows patients to report their PROs, adverse events (AEs), symptoms and more via structured or unstructured conversations. These can be patient initiated and follow decision trees of your choosing.

      subtitle1: Arms & Randomization
      description1: Setup multiple arms for studies including a control arm. The platform also offers multiple computerized randomization of participants, including the configurable choices for stratified, blocked, weighted, and adaptive randomization strategies. Ongoing management of participants via a "triage" view is also available out-of-the-box.
      subtitle2: Enrollment & eConsent
      description2: Setup customized enrollment flows to maximize participant uptake. Run virtual trials in any state and manage it all remotely using tools such as intake surveys and eConsenting. Way to Health has been used to support over 150 different studies and the platform, past and current Principal Investigators (PIs) have credibility among the research and funding communities.

      subtitle1: Gamification & Social
      description1: Games and social media are significant drivers of human behavior. The platform allows patients to earn points, level up, use lifelines and more. These features can be combined with peer competition or support.
      subtitle2: Financial Incentives
      description2: Lotteries, loss and gain framed incentives and much more can be easily applied to activities - steps, weighings, pretty much any data gathered by the platform from any data source. Apply different strategies to different populations and depending on the type of activity.

      subtitle1: Schedule or event driven
      description1: All interventions require recurrence based on a defined period - hours, days, weeks or months or off an event (such as admission). Research studies or clinical deployments both require this to be further tailored by each arm or patient. The platform has been designed to support these use cases and more.
      subtitle2: Alerts & Incidents
      description2: To maximize the productivity of staff and providers, the Way To Health platform allows for the creation of incidents or alerts whenever certain exception criteria are met. Configure notifications depending on the users role.

      subtitle1: Bi-directional integration 
      description1: It is our belief that EHRs should be the system of record for all patient data. Additionally, any provider action needed should also be done via the EHR. With this in mind, the platform provides bi-directional integration currently with Epic (and additional EHRs on request).
      subtitle2: Way to Health inside
      description2: We offer multiple ways in which we can integrate with the EHR. Via embeds in the EHR itself, HL7 based, API (FHIR, Open.Epic, other) and many more as needed.
