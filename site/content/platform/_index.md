        - subtitle: Two-way Texting
          description: Communication with patients and / or study participants is key to engaging them in their health. You can choose from a variety of communication techniques or combine them in interesting ways tailored to a patient's behavior. Texts can be sent out based on set schedules and / or rules. These configuration rules can be as simple as responding with a personalized "Great job, John" or as complex as evaluating blood pressure values and generating with an in-basket message.
        - subtitle: Survey Management
          description: In cases where more data needs to be collected (demographics, symptoms, etc.), the system offers the ability to create a survey. You can either integrate the survey with Qualtrics or create your own survey from scratch using the built-in survey creation and deployment tool. These surveys can be sent out to patients based on specific schedules and simple or complex rules. Short surveys can be administrated over text as well.
